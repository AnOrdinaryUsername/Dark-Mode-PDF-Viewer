## Why make this?

When viewing ebooks on a computer, the bright white backgrounds combined with black text really strained
my eyes, especially when viewing in a dimly lit environment. Although I found other tools to relieve
me of my pain, they weren't without drawbacks, which ranged from limited customization in the case of
Adobe Acrobat Reader, or just didn't work for local files as is the case of Dark Reader.

So I made this to help me and other people who face similar issues.

## Running it locally

Fork the repo and clone it with ssh

```bash
> git clone git@github.com:your-username/Dark-Mode-PDF-Viewer.git
```

Or https

```bash
> git clone https://github.com/your-username/Dark-Mode-PDF-Viewer.git
```

Change to the Dark-Mode-PDF-Viewer directory

```bash
> cd Dark-Mode-PDF-Viewer
```

### Using npm

In the repo folder run

```bash
> npm install
```

Then start up the dev server. It should automatically open [http://localhost:3000/Dark-Mode-PDF-Viewer](http://localhost:3000/Dark-Mode-PDF-Viewer) in your browser.

```bash
> npm start
```
